### Get Started From Scratch

```
❯ npm create vite@latest pathfinding-visualizer -- --template react-ts
❯ npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
❯ npx tailwindcss init -p
❯ npm i
❯ npm run dev
```

Built an interactive tool that visualizes various pathfinding algorithms (such as Dijkstra, A*, and BFS/DFS) to demonstrate their efficiency and behavior in different scenarios. The tool allows users to set start and end points on a grid, place obstacles, and visualize the algorithm finding the shortest path in real time. Developed efficient algorithms and optimized existing solutions for real-world problem-solving scenarios, improving runtime and memory usage.
