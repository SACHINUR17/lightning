Developed an IoT project to monitor environmental humidity and temperature using STM32 microcontroller. Programmed embedded systems with STM32CubeMX and Keil uVision IDE. Implemented real-time data logging and processing, sending sensor data to a cloud server via MQTT. Performed debugging and hardware testing to ensure accurate sensor readings and system stability. Our project involves creating an embedded IoT system using an STM32 microcontroller to monitor and measure environmental conditions, specifically humidity and temperature. The goal is to create a reliable and efficient system for real-time tracking and monitoring of humidity and temperature levels in a specific environment.
